    MAJOR FIX: Complete Poker Game Implementation
    
    CRITICAL FIXES - Poker game is now fully playable:
    
    1. ADDED comprehensive bot AI for Poker:
       - handleBotTurn() method for bot decision making
       - botAction() with hand strength evaluation
       - evaluateHand() for basic poker hand analysis
       - Bots now make realistic decisions (fold, call, raise)
    
    2. IMPROVED visual feedback:
       - Enhanced updatePlayerAreas() with real UI updates
       - Added CSS for player status, bets, and active player highlighting
       - Players now show chips, current bet, and status (Active/Folded/All In)
       - Active player highlighting with gold border
    
    3. ENHANCED game flow:
       - Bot AI automatically called on turn changes
       - Proper turn management with bot integration
       - Realistic timing delays for bot actions (1-3 seconds)
    
    4. FIXED game progression:
       - Games now properly transition through betting rounds
       - Bot turns are handled automatically
       - Better visual feedback throughout the game
    
    The Poker game should now be fully functional with working bots, proper visual feedback, and complete game flow. All other games should also benefit from the server-side fixes.
